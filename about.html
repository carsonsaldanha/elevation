            <p>Hey! Thanks for using this elevation app!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This web app is completely free to use and open source with no ads at all. It was made using 
                    pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click <a href="https://github.com/carsonsaldanha/elevation">here</a> to view the source code on GitHub.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>It's private. There are no analytics, trackers, or cookies.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The app requests your location to get the elevation at your position. Only your coordinates are sent as a secure request to a trusted, external service. 
                            Your location data is not stored by me nor can I access it.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are in the U.S. (with the exception of some spots in Alaska), your elevation request will likely be processed by the
                            <a href="https://nationalmap.gov/epqs">USGS' Elevation Point Query Service</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are outside the U.S., your elevation request will be processed by <a href="https://www.opentopodata.org/api">Open Topo Data</a> using the 
                            <a href="https://www.opentopodata.org/datasets/srtm">SRTM data set</a>, if elevation data is available for the location.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It's also a <a href="https://web.dev/what-are-pwas">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a>! This means you can "install" it on your device
                    for easy access. It works on Android, iOS, iPadOS, Chrome OS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
